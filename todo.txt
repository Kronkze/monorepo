 * changing a model referenced does not mark the row as dirty - cover this by storing edge edit events in the graph
 * need to be able to configure cardinality on model reference slots
 * changing a booking from customer a to customer b leave the old reference to the booking in customer a

 * borders around select boxes in model slot configurer are gone
 * Need to be able to remove a reference in a many model reference slot
 * Need to be able to add a reference in a many model reference slot
 * Need to be able to change a reference in a many model reference slot
 * Inverse reference does not have the right model name in the slot configurer
 * When changing a reference in a has-one relationship to a newly created record, the new edge gets saved twice
 * When setting a reference from a has-many to a has-one, when the has-one is already set, the old reference is not removed. i.e. customer mike points to ticket 1 and ticket 2.  When editing customer tom to point to ticket 1, mike should no longer point to ticket 1
    * this will require a model reference to know whether it is one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many.  Can model as originCardinality and referenceCardinality ?
