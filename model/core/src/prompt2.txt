If I was to ask you to generate a database table for an Invoice, what columns would you put in the table?
Return your answer as a json document containing six properties
The first property is "column name".
The second property is the "description"
The third property is the "data type"
The fourth property is an example value
The fifth property is the "required" flag, containing either "true" or "false"
The sixth property is the "unique" flag, containing either "true" or "false"
The allowed data types are: string, integer, decimal, date, time, boolean, jsonb and foreign_key.
Use foreign key for any columns that you think should reference another table.
Use jsonb when you think the column should contain a JSON object with multiple properties.
Return the 15 most common columns.
Do not include timestamp columns that track record creation and modification times
